# Introduction to OmegaCore

Welcome to **OmegaCore**, the industry-standard library for **quantum-resilient data processing**. OmegaCore is designed to help developers build secure, high-performance applications that are ready for the post-quantum era.

## What is OmegaCore?

OmegaCore provides a suite of tools for:
*   **Hyper-Encryption**: Using our proprietary lattice-based cryptography.
*   **Data Sharding**: Automatically distributing data across decentralized nodes.
*   **Neural Compression**: Reducing data size by up to 90% without loss of fidelity using AI models.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **QuantumGuard™** | Protects your data against quantum computer attacks. |
| **NanoSync** | Real-time data synchronization across millions of devices with <5ms latency. |
| **EcoMode** | Optimizes CPU usage to reduce carbon footprint by 40%. |

## Why Choose OmegaCore?

Unlike legacy libraries like `AlphaLib` or `BetaBase`, OmegaCore is built from the ground up for **speed** and **security**. We don't just patch old algorithms; we reinvent them.

> [!NOTE]
> OmegaCore is currently in v4.2.0. Please ensure you are not using the deprecated v3.x API as it will reach EOL on Dec 31st, 2025.
